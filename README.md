# Payshares Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Payshares/payshares-client.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Payshares/payshares-client)

The Payshares client is an AngularJS application that allows users to interact with the Payshares network from their browser.
This client allows users to register for an account, generate a wallet containing cryptographic keys, and submit transactions to the Payshares network.

You can see it in action here: https://launch.payshares.org

## Security

Encrypting secret data:
 - Secret keys are encrypted in the browser before storing them in a [payshares-wallet](https://github.com/payshares/payshares-wallet) server.
 - Wallets are encrypted using 256bit AES in GCM mode.
 - The key used to encrypt/decrypt a wallet is derived from a username and password using [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt).

Signing transactions:
 - Transactions are signed using the [Ed25519 signature system](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) implemented in [tweetnacl](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).
 - Signing keys are generated randomly during registration.
 - Transactions are signed in the browser before submitting them to a [paysharesd](https://github.com/payshares/paysharesd) server.

## Setting up your dev server

```bash

# Install bower and gulp
npm install -g bower
npm install -g gulp

# Install dev dependencies
npm install

# Install app dependencies
bower install

# (optional) Install phantomjs for automated testing
brew install phantomjs

```

## Starting your dev server

```bash
gulp develop
```

By default, your client will be running against the `stg` environment, which is connected to the payshares testnet.

## Testing against the production wallet and api services

Switching what service endpoints your client is talking too is as simple as running a gulp task and restarting your dev server.

```bash
gulp config-prd
gulp develop
```

`gulp config-prd` will overwrite app/scripts/config.js with the values from config/prd.js, pointing you at the production apis.

## Public Roadmap
