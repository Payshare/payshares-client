  /**
   *
   * The main service that interacts with the trading features of the payshares network.
   *
   * This service provides methods that allows you to create/update/cancel trade offers,
   * as well as giving you means to retrieve {@link Structs.OrderBook} objects to give you information
   * about what trade offers are currently in the network.
   *
   * ### Emitted Events
   *
   * The Trading object broadcasts a series of events from the rootScope that
   * you can hook into to drive logic in your controllers:
   *
   * - `trading:my-offers:canceled`: The payshares network has successfully canceled 
   *   an offer from the current sessions's account 
   * - `trading:my-offers:created-unfilled`: The current account has created 
   *   an offer and it ended up in the appropriate order book unfilled
   * - `trading:my-offers:created-filled`: The current account has created 
   *   an offer and it was immediately filled
   * - `trading:my-offers:created-partially-filled`: The current account has created 
   *   an offer and it ended up in the appropriate order book.  It was also
   *   partially filled.
   * - `trading:my-offers:partially-filled`:  An order from the current account was partially filled by someone else's transaction
   * - `trading:my-offers:filled`: An order from the current account was filled by someone else's transaction
   * - `trading:order-books:updated`: Emitted when an orderbook is updated
   * - `trading:trade`: Emitted when a trade occurs as result of a transaction
   * 
   *
